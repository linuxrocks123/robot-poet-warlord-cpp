Robot gets 20 "skill points" at creation to divide however he wants.
"Creator" can send a message to robot at birth for free, which could
suggest a division.

Primary Attributes:
- Attack (0-10)
- Defense (0-10)
- Power (0-10)
- Health/Charge (0-10)

Each turn:
- Robot has maximum HP of 10*charge skill.
- Robot gains power equal to charge skill each turn.
- Each turn, robot can use up to power skill points each turn to do
  any combination of activities.

Attacks:
- Melee: 50% + (Attack - Defense) chance of hitting
         Amount of power put into attack determines damage and
         increases chance of hit.
         Can't put more power into attack than attack skill.
         Damage if hit: equal to power put into attack
         Chance of hitting:
           attack skill + 0.5*(power put into attack)
- Ranged: Only 50% of attack skill is used, but putting power into
          attack increases chance as normal.
          Range is number of tiles equal to defense level.
- Use ranged energy capsule:
  - No power needed to use.
  - Can only be done if your attack+defense, when added, is equal to
    or greater than the power of the capsule.
  - Damage done is (0.1 * power of capsule * attack level), rounded
    down.
  - Range is (power of capsule + defense level).  No ranged penalty.
  - Attack skill is (power of capsule + attack level).
  - Can only hold a number of capsules equal to (attack+defense).
- Destroy wall/fortification: Wall has 10 health and 10 defense.  Can
  use any method to destroy wall/fortification (melee, ranged,
  capsule).

Defense:
- Defend: Amount of power put into defense determines temporary
          increase of defense points.  Can simultaneously defend and
          attack if power is high enough.  Can't put more power into
          defense than defense skill.

Move:
- Moving one hex takes 1 power.
- Turning is free (no orientation).
- Can see (defense level) hexes in every direction.  Can see
  whether other robots are allies or enemies.  Only way to see
  further is to use 3 power to see the world map.
- Picking up capsule takes 1 power.
- Dropping capsule at adjacent square (for ally to pick up) is free.

Build:
- Build wall: Takes 50 power, cannot be interrupted
- Build fortification: Takes 75 power, cannot be interrupted
- Build energy capsule: takes 10*(power of resulting capsule) power.
  Okay to interrupt.  Can only "hold" (attack+defense) at a time.
- Build robot: Takes (20*total skill of robot) power, cannot be
  interrupted.  Max skill points are 40
- Repair (self or other adjacent robot): 2 power repairs 1 hp damage
- Charge (adjacent robot): 1 power gives 1 charge to adjacent robot

Radio:
  - Messages limited to 64 bytes
  - Can send as many radio signals each turn as you want
    (limited by power) 
  - Reception is free
  - Radio messages don't include ID of robot who sent it; must include
    that in the message if it's important
  - Can't send messages to enemies
  - 1 Power to send radio to nearest neighbor
  - 2 Power to send radio to all allies
  - 3 Power to get a copy of the world map with locations of all
    allies and enemies included.  No IDs of robots included except ID
    of robot sending the message.  Receive copy current turn.
  - 1 Power to scan visible enemy.  Range is equal to defense skill.
    Can't be jammed.

NOTE: JAMMING NOT IMPLEMENTED
*******
Jamming:
  - 1 power to jam at 1 power.
  - 1 power to to overcome jamming at 1 power.
  - Jamming affects allies AND enemies.
  - Jamming lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
  - Jamming range is:
    - 1 Power: 5 hexes at 1 power
    - 2 Power: 6 hexes at 2 power, another 3 at 1
    - 3 Power: 7 hexes at 3 power, another 3 at 2, another 1 at 1
    - 4 Power: 8 hexes at 4 power, another 4 at 3, another 2 at 2,
               another 1 at 1
    - 5 Power: 9 hexes at 5 power, another 4 at 4, another 2 at 3,
               another 1 at 2, another 1 at 1
    - Can't jam at more than 5 power.
  - Can't tell if you're being jammed unless you try to get copy of
    the world and it doesn't work.
  - "All allies" messages downgrade to "nearest neighbor" in presence
    of jamming at 1 power.
  - Jamming of a message is equal to the greater of jamming at sending
    tile and jamming at receiving tile.
  - Receiver and sender can both spend extra power to try and overcome
    jamming.
